Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [*] Hamburger menu
   - [*] Dragging anywhere in the view should reveal the menu.
   - [*] The menu should include links to your profile, the home timeline, and the mentions view.
   - [*] The menu can look similar to the example or feel free to take liberty with the UI.
- [*] Profile page
   - [*] Contains the user header view
   - [*] Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
- [*] Home Timeline
   - [*] Tapping on a user image should bring up that user's profile page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Profile Page
   - [ ] Implement the paging view for the user description.
   - [ ] As the paging view moves, increase the opacity of the background screen. See the actual Twitter app for this effect
   - [ ] Pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image.
- [ ] Account switching
   - [ ] Long press on tab bar to bring up Account view with animation
   - [ ] Tap account to switch to
   - [ ] Include a plus button to Add an Account
   - [ ] Swipe to delete an account


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

  1. Added pull down to on the views
  2. Added infinite scroll view
  3. Used a TableViewCell xib to share the Table view cells across multiple view controllers
  4. Added dynamic Navigation Title based on current user
